# Studies in Sass

This repository is essentially the place where I'm going to store my studies in Sass on my way to mastering this technology.

## Requirements

- Node.js

## How to run the project?

1) Run the command `npm install` to install all project dependencies.

2) Next, execute the command `http-server` to open the project in your browser using the address [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

   - If you prefer to use a specific port for the server, run the command `http-server -p "preferred port"`.

## How to compile the CSS?

1) In the main directory, run the command `sass sass/styles.sass css/styles.css`.

   - Tip: To avoid having to go to the terminal and run the above command every time you make changes to the Sass file, use the command `sass sass/styles.sass css/styles.css --watch`.
